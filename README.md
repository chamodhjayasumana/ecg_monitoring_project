# 🚀 ECG Arrhythmia Classifier for Athletes

This project is an **AI and Deep Learning–based wearable ECG monitoring prototype** for preventing sudden cardiac events in athletes. It demonstrates a Streamlit web app that classifies ECG heartbeats as normal or arrhythmic, using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN).

## 📌 Features

- Upload a heartbeat window (CSV) and get instant classification
- Visualize ECG signals with confidence scores
- Real-time capable design
- Streamlit-based user interface
- Easy to extend for wearable hardware integration

## 🩺 Research Background

Athletes are at risk of **sudden cardiac events (SCEs)** that standard checkups may miss.  
This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept software pipeline to:

- acquire ECG signals  
- apply deep learning for arrhythmia detection  
- provide real-time or near-real-time feedback
